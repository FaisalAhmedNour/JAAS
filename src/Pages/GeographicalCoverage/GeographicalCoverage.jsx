            <p className="mt-10 mb-5">DFEDâ€™s current geographical focus is the location with high concentration of poverty and disadvantaged groups of population and remote locations. It further concentrates investment in areas with high climatic and environmental risk, smaller growth centres and towns with limited services and care, and existing locations with high disaster risk. It continues to monitor the changes in current east-west divide in the distribution of poverty and invest in the north-west part of the country that remains the poorest region of Bangladesh. DFED utilize this dominant macro-analysis as it is very likely to have pockets of poverty within relatively well-off regions. Geographical remoteness such as river and offshore islands, areas affected by salinity intrusion, biodiversity loss and chronic slow onset disaster such as drought. In selected locations, based on the needs and feasibility, the DFED institutional services are being expanded gradually.</p>
