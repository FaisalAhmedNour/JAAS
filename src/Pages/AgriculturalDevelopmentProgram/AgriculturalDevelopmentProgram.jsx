            <p className="mt-10 mb-5">Bangladesh is known for its Agro based economy where the small and marginal farmers are the main driving force of agriculture. To ensure food security of the country there is no alternate to increase agricultural production. The main constraints of achieving food security are less agricultural production, lack of investment, adverse effect of climate change in the form of natural disaster, lack of using appropriate technology, lack of technical knowledge and skill as well as land degradation. It is possible to contribute significant role by MFP through transferring appropriate technology and providing necessary fund among farmers in promoting productivity, increasing food security, improving rural livelihoods, and promoting agriculture as an engine of pro-poor economic growth.</p>
            <p className="mb-5">With the objectives of achieving increased yield through diversification and intensification of agricultural products, DFED MFP has been implementing a specially designed agricultural lending programme since 2010. The salient features of this service include provision of flexible repayment mode, such as one installment, seasonal or balloon repayment, consistent with the seasonal agricultural activities; and the flexibility of having multiple loans to diversify their production.</p>
