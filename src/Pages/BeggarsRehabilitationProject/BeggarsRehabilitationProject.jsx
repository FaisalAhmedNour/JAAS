Begging can be eradicated from the society through improving socio-economic condition of these beggars and establishing their human dignity. In order to create opportunities for those who want to quit begging and return to normal life, Dhaka Ahsania Mission &#40;DAM&#41; has initiated a project to rehabilitate the beggar through DAM Foundation for Economic Development &#40;DFED&#41;. This project has started its full-fledged activities with a view to donating one-time grant money among beggars and involving them in income-generating activities and gradually including them into social safety net programs, offered by public and private institutes, and involving them into ‘Ultra Poor Scheme’ of DFED and thus bringing them back to mainstream in the society.</p>
