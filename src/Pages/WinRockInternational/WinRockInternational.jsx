            <p className="mt-10 mb-5">Winrock International is a nonprofit organization that works with people in the United States and around the world to empower the disadvantaged, increase economic opportunity, and sustain natural resources.</p>
            <p className="mb-5">Winrock International traces its roots to a charitable endeavor established by Winthrop A. Rockefeller at his ranch on Petit Jean Mountain, near Morrilton, Ark. Winrock International Livestock Research and Training Center was created to improve animal agriculture, in part utilizing expertise developed in raising Santa Gertrudis cattle at the mountaintop Winrock ranch.</p>
            <p className="mb-5">In 1985, that institution merged with the Agricultural Development Council (A/D/C) and the International Agricultural Development Service, both founded by Winthrop’s brother, John D. Rockefeller III, to form Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development (Winrock International). Now headquartered in Little Rock, Ark., Winrock International has continued and expanded its mission. Winrock’s significant innovations in agriculture, the environment, clean energy and leadership development help people improve their livelihoods while protecting the resources on which they rely. Dhaka Ahsania Mission (DAM) has been implementing Feed the Future Bangladesh Women’s Empowerment Activity (WEA) project as implementation partner of Winrock International since May 2015 at field level with the management support of DAM Foundation for Economic Development (DFED).</p>
